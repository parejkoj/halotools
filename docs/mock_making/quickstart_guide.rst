Quickstart Guide to Making Mocks
********************************

Any mock galaxy catalog built into an N-body simulation 
is generated by some model of the galaxy-halo connection, 
so to make any mock, you will be using the `~halotools.empirical_models` sub-package:

>>> from halotools import empirical_models

The simplest way to get up and running with a mock galaxy catalog  
is to just use one of the default models that come pre-loaded with Halotools. 
In this quickstart guide, we'll use a simple HOD-style model: 

>>> hod_model = empirical_models.preloaded_models.Zheng07()

The above line of code calls the `~halotools.empirical_models.HodModelFactory` 
and returns a model object based on Kravtsov et al. (2004), arXiv:0308519. 
For a list of other out-of-the-box model options you can choose from, see 
:ref:`list_of_default_models`. 

All models in Halotools come with a built-in ``populate_mock`` method that 
allows you to create a synthetic galaxy catalog with one line of code:

>>> hod_model.populate_mock() # doctest: +SKIP

Calling the `~halotools.empirical_models.HodModelFactory.populate_mock` method 
with no arguments, as above, automatically retrieves the default simulation snapshot
and generates a Monte Carlo realization of your model into those simulated halos. 
The resulting mock catalog can then be accessed via:

>>> hod_model.mock.galaxy_table # doctest: +SKIP

The ``galaxy_table`` attribute is an Astropy Table storing the entire 
collection of mock galaxies, including all properties your model was designed to predict.
